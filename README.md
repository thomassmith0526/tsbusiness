the first thing that I did was create an array so i could make sure that i could check the functions worked and that i had to make to fine the random emploee and the avgrage salary of the emplyoees are.
after creating a for loop for the salary while working with Micah on how to build the for loop i was able to get the avgs.
to get the random employee function i googled how to get a random name out of a an array and was give the function that i used here.
moving on do the collect employess function we need to use a while loop, and how to learn how to use promt. i worked with Duffy, Micah, and Samuel to get this to work. after there help i was able to learn how while loops work and that you need to return ur value to get the info you want.
